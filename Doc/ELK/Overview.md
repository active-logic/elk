# ELK overview [WIP DOC]

ELK is designed to help you create new languages in C#, without starting from scratch.

[CODE EXAMPLE]

Since many programming languages share common requirements, a *mix, match and tweak* approach may be effective, giving you a 2-8 weeks head start depending on your experience and what you're trying to achieve.

In this context, a language is defined as a suite of language related services:

- Running a program given specified input (such as text source, or a file path)
- Generating a runnable program, which you then invoke over and over without having to repeat the parsing phase
- Generating and exporting parse trees
- Transpiling - generate a graph, then convert the output to program source for another language
