## Can I get a commercial license?

Since Elk and BTL are in pre-alpha, I am not offering commercial licenses; you may still license ELK via [AGPL](../license-AGPL) or [fair source](../license-Fair-Source).

If you absolutely need a commercial license (such as: making a game, and your team is over 5 people), please get in touch via active.behaviours [at] gmail.com

Commercial licenses will be made avaible via the Unity Asset Store (ETA: October 2022) and other venues.

## Why not the MIT license

Early testing shows BTL gives game developers an *edge*; five free lunches is good enough!
